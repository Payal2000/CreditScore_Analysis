# Credit Scoring and Segmentation Project

Credit scoring is a crucial aspect of the financial industry that involves assessing the creditworthiness of individuals or businesses to determine the likelihood of them repaying borrowed funds. Credit scoring often involves creating a credit score for each borrower, which helps lenders make informed decisions about whether to approve a loan, what interest rate to offer, and what credit limit to set.

## Project Overview

This project showcases the concepts of credit scoring and segmentation using Python. It provides insights into evaluating the creditworthiness of individuals or businesses and dividing them into distinct groups based on their credit profiles. The project aims to help financial institutions make informed lending decisions and manage credit risk effectively.

## Credit Scoring

Credit scoring involves calculating credit scores for borrowers based on their credit profiles. The provided Python scripts use a weighted formula to assess creditworthiness. The script demonstrates how to preprocess data, apply the credit scoring formula, and incorporate different factors such as payment history, credit utilization, and more.

## Customer Segmentation

Customer segmentation is performed using K-means clustering to group individuals or businesses based on their credit profiles. The segmentation script showcases how to preprocess data, apply K-means clustering, and visualize the resulting segments. 

This helps in understanding different credit risk levels among customers.

## Conclusion

Credit scoring and segmentation using Python offer powerful tools for financial institutions and businesses to make informed decisions when it comes to lending and credit risk management.

By leveraging data-driven approaches, these techniques allow for a comprehensive evaluation of creditworthiness and the categorization of individuals or businesses into meaningful segments.

Credit scoring takes into account various factors, including payment history, credit utilization, and other relevant attributes, to quantify the likelihood of borrowers repaying their debts. 

This objective assessment aids financial institutions in identifying trustworthy borrowers and setting appropriate lending terms.
